## Setting Up an Empty React Project

To create a new React project using Vite, run the following command:

```sh
npm create vite@latest react-project
```

Follow the prompts to configure your project, then navigate into the project folder and install dependencies:

```sh
cd react-project
npm install
```

To start the development server, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will launch the React application in your default browser.
